    <h3> Techniques to Highlight Meaningful Changes in Visualizations: </h3>

    <ol>
      <li> Moving Average </li>
        <ul>
          <li> A new form of a trendline that resembles the shape of the
               shape of the raw data more than a linear model and better
               fits the data. The computer divides the the time series
               into smaller chunks and calculates an average for each chunk,
               rather than the entire period, as was the case before.
               There are many kinds of moving averages including, but not
               limited to: simple, arithmetic, weighted, and exponential.
          </li>
        </ul>
      <li> Zero-Based Index</li>
        <ul>
          <li> A way to better represent the relative change in a
               visualization. It uses an index origin (the 0 percent in the
               charts), which is the average from the point of inflection
               on a raw score chart, to base the percent change values off.
               In this form of a chart the y-axis is the difference between
               a value and the index origin that has been chosen.
         </li>
        </ul>
      <li> Logarithmic Scale </li>
        <ul>
          <li> These scales allow users to visualize the patterns of
                change for data sets with extremely large values easier.
                By changing the y-axis scale to an integer power of a
                chosen base number (usually 10), the axis is able to be
                human-friendly. Without log transofrmations rates of
                change may become invisible to the naked eye.
          </li>
        </ul>
    </ol>
